# learning-objectives-CSC207

Author: Livia Stein Freitas

A portfolio for my CSC 207 class (Object Oriented Programming, Data Structures, and Algorithms) demonstrating my mastery of each learning objetive. Each file is named after the objective(s) it showcases. It contains a description of the code and what it accomplishes. 
For example: "This is a functioning Quick Sort algorithm. It demonstrates my understanding of how sorting algorithms work and how to implement them."
